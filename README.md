# GitH-Correct Chrome Extension
![](/GitH-Correct-Demo.gif)

Ever scrolled through a website and stumbled upon "Github" written like it's some casual acquaintance and not the code repository deity that it is? Oh, the horror! If you've ever wished you could file a pull request against the entire internet to fix this blasphemous typo, your prayers (or rants) have been answered. 

While we can't fix the people who write "Github" or their websites, we can at least save your eyes from ever having to see it again. Consider it a public service for your sanity.

Introducing GitH-Correct Chrome Extension: the unsung hero that auto-corrects "Github" to "GitHub"â€”yes, with the all-important capital 'H'. Because if we can't fix people, at least we can fix their typos.

Inspired by this tweet from [Adam DuVander](https://twitter.com/adamd/status/1714416760261112097), who couldn't bear the sight and neither should you.
